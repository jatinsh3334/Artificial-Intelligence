# Simple Lisp Program â€“ Addition Example

## Introduction to Lisp
Lisp (short for **LISt Processing**) is one of the oldest high-level programming languages, originally developed in the late 1950s by John McCarthy.  
It is primarily known for its powerful features in **symbolic computation**, **artificial intelligence**, and **functional programming**.  

Lisp treats **code as data** and **data as code**, which makes it extremely flexible.  
All operations in Lisp are written in the form of **parenthesized lists**, also known as *S-expressions*.

For example:
```lisp
(+ 2 3)
